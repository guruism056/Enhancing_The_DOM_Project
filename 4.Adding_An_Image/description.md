* We add an image in the overlay.First we create a new image element (using document.createElement).
* The images and the curresponding thumbnails are saved in the images/artists folder.
* If an image is named "abc.jpg" its corresponding thumbnail is named "abc_tn.jpg".
* So we get the source of the image file by using the substring method.
* Once source for large image is obtained we add the image to the overlay. (appendChild).
