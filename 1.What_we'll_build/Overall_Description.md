# Overall Description Of the Project
* The project consists of a website with 5 web pages in total.
* The  "artists.html" page (or the "ARTISTS" nav in the site) consists of a list of thumbnails of images.
* We add a javascript file to this page so that whenever a thumbnail is clicked the large image is loaded at the center of the page as an overlay.Also the image gets removed if we click anywhere on the page.
